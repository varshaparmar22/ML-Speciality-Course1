Inferential Statistics

- process of using the data and perform analysis so we can deduce(draw conclusion) properties of probability distribution

Population = > whole dataset => characterstics => parameters(value from entie population)
sample = > chosen datapoints => characterstics => statics(value from sample)

IS types - use the confidence interval to test parameters of population
1. Hypothesis Testing: null HT, alternate HT(types : z test, f test, t test, anova test, u test)
2. Regression Analysis : linear, nominal, logistic ordinal regression

-samples you choose should represent the entire population for IS
-will use confidence interval to test parameters of population
- we will generalize the statics of population by performing analysis on population sample data


$$$$$$ Parameter Space $$$$$$$$
set of value can be fall into Population Parameter


$$$$$$ Sample Space $$$$$$$$
set of samples drawn from population


$$$$$$ Sampling Distribution $$$$$$$$
distribution of statics for different (type of )sample(positive or negative)

$$$$$$ Standard Error $$$$$$$$
standard deviation of sampling distribution of statics called standard error

$$$$$$ Estimation $$$$$$$$$$$$$$

obtaining most likely value of population parameter using statics

2 types:
point estimation
interval estimation

to learn about population parameter from sample staics techniques are

Estimation & Hypothesis Testing

- the statics which is used to estimate value of population parameters is called point estimator(formula)
- that most likely value estimated is called estimate(value)

$$$$$$ Bias of Estimator $$$$$$$$$

Difference between estimated parameter value(by estimator) and actual parameter value
- if both value are same BOE = 0
- if diff is there than estimator is calles bias


$$$$$$ Point Estimation $$$$$$$$$

point estimations are single value that estimated population paramters from statics
like sample mean and sample proportion is point estimation for population means & proportion


$$$$$$ Interval Estimation $$$$$$$$$

- interval estimation defined by two numbers
- within these two number range value of population parameter is lies

so this define confidence level by upper value and lower value of interval estimation


$$$$$$ Hypothesis Testing $$$$$$$$444

- test the assumption and draw the conclusion about population from sample data
- we have to set NHT and AHT to check those assumption



$$$$$$$ Regression Aanlysis $$$$$$$$$ 

- How one variable will changed with respect to the other variable
-  Regression Analysis : linear, nominal, logistic ordinal regression

$$$$$ Confidence Interval $$$$$$$$$$

amount of uncertainity associated when sample estimate the population parameter

3 parts 
- confidence level
-statics
-margin of error


$$$$$$ confidence level $$$$$$$$

- probability part of confidence interval is CL
- it  describe that sampling method produce confidence interval which specify no of percentage that probabilty of
  true population parameter
- Probability distribution is bell shaped curve
- 95% CL means 95 interval have true population parameters lies init

$$$$$ Margin of Error $$$$$$$$$$

the range ofvalues above and below the sample statics is ME
say ME =5%
receive vote 40%
confidence level = 95%

so candidate will receive vote 35%-45% vote that  Newspaper saying with 95% confidence level

construction of confidence interval

1. identify sample's statics: statics to use for estimation of population parameter
2. select the confidence level : describe uncertainity of sampling method
3. find margin of error : critical value * standard deviation or critical value * standard error
4. specify confidence level : sample statics and margin error




$$$$$ Hypothesis Testing $$$$$$$$$$

- Hypothesis is a claim or current belief. 
- Null Hypothesis(Current Belief -  may not be exactly right all the time-  either accept or reject)

Steps for HT

1. Define NHT, AHT(rejection of NHT)
2. find statistics to check NHT 
3. find the criteria based on which NHT is accepted or rejected(significance value p)
4. calculate the probability value (p) when NHT is true - genraly 5% is p value we consider for this 
5. based on p value accept or reject NHT 


$ 0.05

P Value: percentage value 
p-val > $ : fail to reject NHT(not a significant result)
p-val <= $ : reject NHT(significant result)


Critical Value
beyond this value from 2 step statics we will reject NHT

Test statics < c-val : fail to reject NHT
Test statics >= c-val : reject NHT


$$$$$$$$$$$ Z Test $$$$$$$$$$$

- by z test we will compare statics of sample
- specially mean of sample
- actual mean and assumed mean
- when sample size is larger than 30
- variance is know
- used to estimate relationship between actual mean and assumed mean
