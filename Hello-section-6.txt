= if shows directory considering python
= otherwise you have to install it in that directory(or point it - not explore right now)
= create a app.py file with flask code
= templates folder
= create venv in your folder ->   python -m venv mldeployment-demo
= activate venv -> mldeployment-demo\Scripts\activate
	- if not activated then open windows powershell as administrator and run below command to allow execution locally on folder
	- Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine
	- you will see venv as in (mldeployment-demo) in cmd of vs code
	- env is active now
	- if current folder has any requirements.txt file all extension will be installed on the spot
	- i got scikit version issue to run section 6 demo
	- install scikit oldr versio by 
	- pip install scikit-learn==1.2.2
