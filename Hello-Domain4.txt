AWS Lambda
- serverless
- upload code and run it
- charges based on running time period
- infrastructure will be taken care by aws

Tensorflow Lite
- to generate the prediction
for that
- save the model
- convert TF model in TF lite model
- tf lite 50 mb
- load saved model
- keras provide tf lite converter functionality
- create object of tf lite for given model
- keras image preprocessor will help for image preprocessing(changing dimension of image)
- install tf lite runtime to load our converted lite model
- tflite interpreter is used to access input/output and get prediction from given tf lite model
- to deploy in aws lambda we have to create lambda handler file
- having lambda handler function in it, event and context as arguments.
- this function will be invoke by aws

DOCKER

- containerizer and manager tool - Develop, Run and Ship anywhere
- to deploy ml app, we need to package all the dependencies of app into one so our app can run
- docker is isolated space where ml app can run by using resources

docker consist the container
- container is sanbox process on host machine which is isolated from all other process on host machine
- it is one kind of isolated machine on host
- we can start, stop, move, delete container by using Docker API or CLI
- container image is isolated filesystem - specify all dependencies for container to run like configuration, scripts, dependencies, binaries, environment variables, commands to run etc
- container is instance of image
- we can pull docker image from docker hub
- run the image will create the container and run your code in that container
- interactive run on container can be done(in side container run all commands no need to specify run docker every time)
- only once -> docker run -it busybox sh
- you have to specify docker file to create container for docker image -  having all command 


CloudWatch
= monitor the resources and application
= create alarm for many things like cpu usage is more than 30%, billing alarm
= automation possible by using cloud watch - like if model taking much time to train
= it will create log for most of service of aws
= logs are in log group
= you create event too based on rules(Amazon EventBridge service) - perform another action - automation by cloudwatch rule link



@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ SageMaker @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@

Protobuf : Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) is a free and open-source cross-platform data format used to serialize structured data.

All models are available in sagemaker are prebuilt docker images

from sagemaker import image_uris, model_uris, script_uris
container = image_uris.retrieve('knn', boto3.Session().region_name, 'latest')

retrive is function to get that docker image

first create sagemaker session and call estimator
sagemaker.estimator.Estimator : highlevel interface for segemaker training, handle end-to-end sagemaker training and deployment tasks

model.deploy function to deploy given trained model- which will create end-point for model deployment
endpoint - can be used to access in labmda function for automation, info about instance, setting for it, under inference tab in SGM
EP is used to invoke new data - test new data


SageMaker JumpStart : place where you can find pore-trained model for your ML projects start.
1. foundation model : pre-trained model on large amount of data so you can create article summarization, text-video-image generation
2. computer vision model : Pre-trained model takes image as input and give selected type of output like classification, object detection, semantic segmentation all related to images
3. natural language processing : Same pre-trained model like text classification/summarization, machine translation, sentence pair classification, Named Entity Recongnition, Question-answering and text generation

you can use this model finetune them for your project or just train by using your own data and use the trained feature or customize model as per requirment.

@@@@ Model Lineage in Machine Learning - (lineage - getting something from ancestors)

Model lineage is a set of associatation between model and all other components which are involved into creation of that model like

For Model lineage Sagemaker Provides many features

1. SGM Studio - its a IDE provide framework for ML solution to create
